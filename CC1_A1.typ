= How does the demand for academic rigor shape the way we transform observation into discourse?

"_King Arthur came a lot, didn't he?_" Pfft. No, King Arthur's _Camelot_ is the castle and court associated with him. Silly. But I let out a hysterical laugh when I recalled this gag from the British mockumentary _Cunk on Earth_. It seemed like my lecturer also enjoyed the show, because she showed a clip of a funny interaction regarding A.I. There was a certain charm to her: throwing her hands up, monologuing her thoughts, and lightly bouncing on her feet. As though this lesson segment offered her the perfect excuse to share what she genuinely liked; to segue into a throwaway joke she enjoyed. 


There were some blank faces. Some eyes darted around the room. Some let out a courtesy laugh. Perhaps they didn't get her ad-hoc comedic relief. The humour seemed to rely on understanding --- knowing enough to realize the absurdity.

I skimmed through NTULearn. I scrolled to find a collection of essays written by previous students in the _Pioneer Road Journal_. This might be a goldmine. I thirst for inspiration as I scour with spelunking eyes --- digging up ideas from title to title, sentence to sentence.

A strange feeling hit me: I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over again. There is a wall of text: filled with hyperbole and animated description. Then comes a _monument_ of text: filled with citations and academic literature. Each essay always begins with vivid lived experiences, before quickly pivoting into a formal "research voice", as though the upcoming rhetorical questions act as a required hinge rather than genuine uncertainty. The pivot feels suspect --- rehearsed --- as if the flamboyance of observation was carefully calibrated to land on a predetermined question. I wondered if these details existed solely to justify a conclusion that waited quietly in the background. Perhaps we manufacture meaning as a byproduct of trying to meet academic expectations. If so, that feels deeply cynical; and if not, how will I know?

I catch myself doing the same thing --- scrolling back to my own field notes, alt-tabbing to check whether the essays in _Pioneer Road Journal_ validate my writing style. How much performativity should I display? Have I written descriptively enough to _qualify_ myself a reason to talk about something that _I_ enjoyed? If observation must eventually transform into a thesis, then I suspect that I do not merely record what I see; I also search for what can be argued. 



=== It’s about manufacturing meaning under structural expectations.
