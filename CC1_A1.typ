"_King Arthur came a lot, didn't he?_" 

Pfft. No, King Arthur's _Camelot_ refers to his associated court. Silly. But I let out a hysterical laugh when I recalled this gag from the British mockumentary _Cunk on Earth_. It seemed like my lecturer also enjoyed the show, because she showed a clip of a funny interaction between _Philomena Cunk_ and _Jim Al-Khalili_ regarding A.I. There was a certain charm to her: throwing her hands up, monologuing her thoughts, and lightly bouncing on her feet. As though this lesson briefly offered her the perfect excuse to share what she genuinely liked; to segue into a throwaway joke she enjoyed. 

Tucked in the corner of the building, my classroom reacted unevenly. Some classmates had blank faces. Some eyes darted around the room. Some let out a courtesy laugh. Perhaps they didn't get her ad-hoc comedic relief. It made sense: there really wasn't any link between _Cunk on Earth_ and the topic of "_finding reliable sources_"; it might even be the complete opposite. But this got me wondering how the joke felt memmomentarily justified because it fit the setting; it felt warranted because we were discussing A.I.'s use for op-eds. I brimmed enthusaistically knowing I got her reference.

But what I didn't get were ideas for my own op-ed. I stare at my screen Lackadaisically, I skimmed through NTULearn. I scrolled to find a collection of essays written by previous students in the _Pioneer Road Journal_. This might be a goldmine. I thirst for inspiration as I scour with spelunking eyes --- digging up ideas from title to title, sentence to sentence. Each page seemed to archive deep insight and quirky topics; I took my notes and my time. 

A strange feeling crept up on me as I continue reading more and more: There is a wall of text, filled with hyperbole and animated description. Then comes a _monument_ of text, filled with citations and academic literature. Each essay always begins with vivid lived experiences, before quickly pivoting into a formal "research voice", as though the upcoming rhetorical questions act as a required hinge rather than genuine uncertainty. The pivot feels suspect --- rehearsed --- as if the flamboyance of observation was carefully calibrated to land on a predetermined question. I wondered if these details existed solely to justify a conclusion that waited quietly in the background. 

Perhaps we manufacture meaning as a byproduct of trying to meet academic expectations.      

I catch myself doing the same thing --- scrolling back to my own field notes, alt-tabbing to crosscheck whether the essays in _Pioneer Road Journal_ validate how I have written; taping my face to the text, trying to study the structure. How much performativity should I display? How saturated should my essay be? Have I written descriptively enough to qualify myself a reason to talk about something that _I_ enjoy?  If observation must eventually transform into a thesis, then I suspect that I do not merely record what I see; I also search for what can be argued. Op-eds --- it seems --- are meant to be deeply personal; idiosyncratic. How, then, does the demand for academic rigor shape the way we transform observation into discourse?

1. #underline[What did you enjoy most in observing and writing about your chosen topic? 
]
\
I liked doing the "meta-analysis" on the writing practices of the op-eds I've seen. I don't know --- I thought it was quite funny and interesting and insightful to pick apart these things. I picked up on how flowery the language was, then noticed the tonal shift when we started going into the knitty gritty if-I'm-not-interested-I-won't-really-_read_-_read_-this-section parts. Where did all the emotional expression go! Then I just contemplated how manipulated our writing can get. If I pay attention not for the sake of curiosity but for the sake of conjuring a thesis statement, have I really done something? 

\
2. #underline[
What did you find most challenging, as you analyzed your topic?
]
\
The most challenging part is naming the "problem". How can I meaningfully word the feeling of doing this analysis work and then coming up with something to write about? The... for lack of a better word, performativity of analysis? It's not necessarily a bad thing --- the  rubric probably demands it --- but to me I thought it could be interesting; How far can you extract meaning until you're doing too much; How credible can you be to yourself if you cannot think of anything. The issue then is that I have to:
#list(
    [Describe the process accurately],
    [Figure out how to connect it to my own observations],
    [Describe the consequences]
)
Frankly, I still cannot really fully and accurately explain to myself what I want to get across. Not laconically at least. I have the research question. I think I just need to flush out the details.

3. #underline[What aspect of your assignment would you like the most feedback on? Write a question
that you can guide your teacher in giving feedback that could be most meaningful to you
as you move forward in class?]

I think this module's breadth is quite large, right? e.g., there's no guideline on how _formal_ this part of the reflection needs to be (I'm vibe-typing and throwing whatever comes to mind in a word-salad).
 Does my exploration of how academic rigor shapes observation feel thoughtful and nuanced, or does it risk sounding overly cynical? Does it feel organic? Do you think there are any branching paths / room for further analysis?

 Basically, if I write my current reserach question, I want to try writing light satire. I demonstrate the effect while naming it. Is this thematically possible? How... rigourous must the op-ed be (how ironic)? What if I want to "cite" non-academic stuff in my op-ed? i.e., the way a certain book I own is written --- and the implications of its story?
