Hello Script

*Bold* _Italics_

"_King Arthur came a lot, didn't he?_" Pfft. No,  King Arthur's _Camelot_ is
the castle and court associated with him. 
How silly. But I let out a hysterical laugh when I recalled this
gag in the British mockumentary _Cunk on Earth_. 
This memory  resurfaced after my lecturer showed us a similar
skit on A.I. in preparation for writing our op-ed assignment.
The show writers must be brilliant if they could come up with entertainingly strung 
_non-sequiturs_ to derail even academics and experts in the field.

Some blank faces. Some eyes dart around the room. Some let out a courtesy laugh. 
Perhaps they just did not get her ad-hoc comedic relief. It reminds me of the term
_Elite Ball Knowledge_ --- which quietly means the knowledge that only experienced sports players
can learn over many years; but is loudly used to describe someone's nuanced 
understanding of certain niche topics or references.

\ 
Right. Op-ed. After my lecturer moved on from said skit, I skimmed through the NTULearn. I
scroll to find a collection of essays written by previous students in the _Pioneer Road Journal_.
I thirst for inspiration. I scour with darting eyes --- title to title, sentence to sentence.

-
Something feels off. I feel like I am reading the same structure over and over again.
There's a wall of text: filled with hyperbole and animated description.
Then comes a monument of text: filled with citations and academic literature.
The first part bores me; the latter scares me. 
\
\
\

Current research qn idea: By what standards do we use to decide whether
an interpretation is warranetd?\
But also this seems this question seems way too pointed---
\
\
\

_As I type this sentence, I wonder how my writing practice is being shaped?_ \
_Have I written descriptively enough to be worthy of your continued reading?_\
What are the consequences of amalgamating writing subjective essays with 
the academic requirement for rigor and answer?


I will probably have to narrow down this scope because it's way too hard to
provide a satisfying answer (to me). Also because I need it to be more CC1 centered.
