Hello Script

*Bold* _Italics_

"_King Arthur came a lot, didn't he?_" Pfft. No,  King Arthur's _Camelot_ is the castle and court associated with him. How silly. But I let out a hysterical laugh when I recalled this gag in the British mockumentary _Cunk on Earth_. This memory  resurfaced after my lecturer showed us a similar skit on A.I. in preparation for writing our op-ed assignment. The show writers must be brilliant if they could come up with entertainingly strung non-sequiturs to derail even academics and experts in the field.

Some blank faces. Some eyes dart around the room. Some let out a courtesy laugh. Perhaps they just did not get her ad-hoc comedic relief. It reminds me of the term _Elite Ball Knowledge_ --- which quietly means the knowledge that only experienced sports players can learn over many years; but is loudly used to describe someone's nuanced understanding of certain niche topics or references.

\ Right. Op-ed. After my lecturer moved on from said skit, I skimmed through the slides.

Current research qn idea: By what standards do we use to decide whether an interpretation is warranetd?\
But also this seems this question seems way too pointed---
