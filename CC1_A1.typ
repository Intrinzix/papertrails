"_King Arthur came a lot, didn't he?_" Pfft. No,  King Arthur's _Camelot_ is
the castle and court associated with him. 
How silly. But I let out a hysterical laugh when I recalled this
gag in the British mockumentary _Cunk on Earth_. My lecturer was in class discussing how to
find reliable soruces for our op-ed. She had let us watch a funny clip from the show --- 
on the subject of artifical intelligence. There was a certain charm to it; throwing her hands up,
monologuing her thoughts, lightly bouncing on her feet. 
As though this lesson segment was a perfect excuse for her to share what she found funny; 
to segue into a throwaway joke she enjoyed. 


Some blank faces. Some eyes dart around the room. Some let out a courtesy laugh. 
Perhaps they just didn't get her ad-hoc comedic relief. It reminds me of the term
_Elite Ball Knowledge_ --- which quietly means the knowledge that only experienced sports players
can learn over many years; but is loudly used to describe someone's nuanced 
understanding of certain niche topics or references. Via telepathy, I hope she knew,
if anything, at least _I_ got it.
\ 

But what I didn't get were ideas for my op-ed. I skimmed through the NTULearn. I
scroll to find a collection of essays written by previous students in the _Pioneer Road Journal_.
I thirst for inspiration. I scour with darting eyes --- title to title, sentence to sentence.

Strange. I felt like I was reading the same structure over and over again.
There is a wall of text: filled with hyperbole and animated description.
Then comes a _monument_ of text: filled with citations and academic literature.
The first part bores me; the latter scares me. It begins with vivid lived experiences
before quickly pivoting into formal "research voice", as though the rhetorical question
coming up feels like a required hinge rather than genuine uncertainty. To me, a
place is a place;  a community is a community. I didn't get it. 
Is there some _Ball Knowledge_ I'm missing? No magician could train me to pull these 
thoughts out of my thinking cap, and no seamstress could teach me to stitch these words together.

Current research qn idea: By what standards do we use to decide whether
an interpretation is warranetd?\
But also this seems this question seems way too pointed---
\
\
\

_As I type this sentence, I wonder how my writing practice is being shaped?_ \
_Have I written descriptively enough to be worthy of your continued reading?_\
What are the consequences of amalgamating eassys with 
the academic requirement for rigor and answer?


I will probably have to narrow down this scope because it's way too hard to
provide a satisfying answer (to me). Also because I need it to be more CC1 centered.
