= How does the demand for academic rigor shape the way we transform observation into writing? 
\

"_King Arthur came a lot, didn't he?_" Pfft. No, King Arthur's _Camelot_ is
the castle and court associated with him. How silly. But I let out a hysterical laugh when I recalled this gag in the British mockumentary _Cunk on Earth_. My lecturer was discussing how to reliable soruces for our op-ed, and she had let us watch a funny clip from the show on the subject of artifical intelligence. There was a certain charm to it; throwing her hands up, monologuing her thoughts, lightly bouncing on her feet. As though this lesson segment was a perfect excuse for her to share what she found funny; 
to segue into a throwaway joke she enjoyed. 


There were some blank faces. Some eyes darted around the room. Some let out a courtesy laugh. Perhaps they just didn't get her ad-hoc comedic relief. It reminds me of the term
_Elite Ball Knowledge_ --- which quietly means the knowledge that only experienced sports have; but is loudly used to describe a nuanced understanding of certain niche topics and references. Telepahtically, I assured her
that for what it's worth, _I_ could get it. I have the insider knowledge.
\ 

But what I didn't get were ideas for my op-ed. I skimmed through NTULearn. I scrolled to find a collection of essays written by previous students in the _Pioneer Road Journal_. This might be a goldmine. I thirst for inspiration and I scour with spelunking eyes --- digging up ideas from title to title, sentence to sentence.


Strange. I felt like I was reading the same structure over and over again. There is a wall of text: filled with hyperbole and animated description. Then comes a _monument_ of text: filled with citations and academic literature. It always begins with vivid lived experiences, before quickly pivoting into a formal "research voice", as though the upcoming rhetorical questions act as a required hinge rather than genuine uncertainty. The pivot feels suspect --- rehearsed --- as if the flamboyance of observations is carefully calibrated to land on a predetermined question.  Is there some academic _Ball Knowledge_ I'm missing? 

I write this  cursor blinks. I highlight a phrase, unhighlight it, and delete it, wondering whether the words I choose sound like _me_; because as I near my 400th word, I begin to wonder if the way I write is being manipulated.. ??

_As I type this sentence, I wonder how my writing practice is being shaped?_ \
_Have I written descriptively enough to be worthy of your continued reading?_\




=== It’s about manufacturing meaning under structural expectations.
